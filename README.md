In this project, we worked as a team of three people, each responsible for a different area. One team member was in charge of the movie list screen, the movie viewing screen, and the new movie addition screen for the web version. Another team member was responsible for the same screens in the Android version. The third team member was responsible for login and registration on both platforms.

We used the Jira management tool for task allocation and project management, which enabled effective teamwork, with each member contributing their part to the project.

How to run the project:

Start the server using npm start, which will open the video list screen. After that, there will be an option to log in at the top, and if there is no user, to register.

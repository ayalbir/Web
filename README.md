# Web Project

## Introduction
This project is a collaborative effort by a team of three, focusing on creating a web application with a React-based client-side and a server-side backend. The purpose of the project is to continue to work on the FooTube project, in this part, with a Server.

## Project Structure
- **Client-Side**: Developed using React.
- **Server-Side**: Hosted in a separate repository [Server Repo](https://github.com/ayalbir/Server).

## Team Contributions
- One team member was responsible for the server-side development.
- Two team members focused on the client-side development using React.
- After completing the server-side, the team member joined the client-side efforts, ensuring seamless integration between the client and server.

## Project Management
- We utilized the Jira management tool for task allocation and project management, enabling effective teamwork and contribution from each member.

## How to Run the Project

- Node.js installed on your system, from the Server Repo (after cloning it). more details in the Server Repo.
- When the App is initialized, there no videos/users in the DB, so the client needs to create them.
